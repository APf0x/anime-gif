# anime-gif README

Ok so you better read this because it is not going to work if you dont.

Basically this is a anime-gif window that plays gifs while youre working on your projects.
So you may be asking yourself why is it not working if it does not work?
So basically to avoid any copyright (i dont want to risk it) i didnt put any gifs inside of the svelte script so i can avoid any copyright claims so you will have to do it by yourself.
and i forgot to add that you cannot play gifs if not online.

**i will give a answer to all of these problems in this documentation**

## why?

why not?

# how do i add more gifs

basically if you're on a windows macchine, **you're on your own**, because i dont want to boot in my windows macchine and find a way to import those gifs.

if you're on linux, ubuntu specifically i can help you, you just have to do the the next actions.

## if you're on any linux macchine (ubuntu precisely)

1) open your terminal
2) goto `cd .vscode/extensions`
3) type `ls`
4) somewere you should find a folder named anime-gif so you just copy the directory and get in it it should be `cd anime-gif`
5) once you're in anime-gif you will have to get in `cd webviews/components` and type `ls`
6) ok so you finaly made it at this point you ignore the `helloworld.svelte` file since it is not used/usless so you just gotta type in `nano sidebar.svelte` 
7) at this point you goto line `2` and insert any link you want
8) if at this point you need any further help (fucking impossible) feel free to contact me on discord (my info will be on the last paragraph).

## if you're on windows 

1) i told you you're on your own


# how do i play these gifs offline
